/*
 * Vehicle Matcher — Adobe Edge Delivery Services (EDS) block. The shell.
 *
 * A brand-agnostic matcher: the brand (BMW, MINI, …) is authored config, not
 * baked in. This file is the SHELL around one or more interchangeable interface
 * "modes" (see modes/) that all drive the same engine (server/, via engine.js):
 *
 *   - It reads authored block config (brand, retailer, copy overrides, API base).
 *   - It applies the brand theme and builds the mode switcher + a stage element.
 *   - It picks which mode to mount:
 *       • a "Mode" config row (or ?mode=) locks the block to one interface and
 *         hides the switcher — the production case, one interface per page;
 *       • with no lock, every registered mode gets a switcher tab and the
 *         visitor can flip between them — the showcase case.
 *
 * The shell knows nothing about any mode's internals: a mode is just
 * { key, label, mount(root, ctx) }. Adding an interface touches modes/, not here.
 *
 * The API base comes from an authored "API" config row when running on EDS
 * (authored content can set config rows but not HTML attributes), or from a
 * `data-api` attribute for the local harness and the GitHub Pages build,
 * falling back to http://localhost:8787 for local preview. See apiBase.

 *      it (the harness's ?api= override writes here too), so a query override
 *      always wins;
 *   2. an authored "API" config row — the EDS path, because authored content
 *      can produce config rows but not HTML attributes;
 *   3. the localhost default, for `npm run serve`.
 * Trailing slashes are trimmed so `${base}/api/...` never doubles up. An empty
