/*
 * Shared "signal" helpers for the game modes (Swipe / MINI Mingle and the
 * Head-to-head / MINI Knockout championship). Both modes do the same core job:
 * they let a player express taste over a deck of real stock, then turn that taste
 * into the SAME answer keys the questionnaire mode produces and hand them to the real
 * engine. The engine — not the game — picks the match (see the mode docs).
 *
 * These helpers are the mode-agnostic, brand-safe pieces of that job:
 *   - display: SHADE_HEX / swatchFor / priceLabel / gbpShort / cap
 *   - deck:    shuffle
 *   - reading: modal / rankByFrequency
 *   - seed:    budgetBandsFromQuestion / useTilesFromQuestion
 *   - infer:   swipesToAnswers (swipe) / bracketToAnswers (knockout)
 *   - reveal:  celebrate (the shared confetti crescendo)
 *
 * They were originally private to mingle.js; extracted here so the two game modes
 * share ONE tuning surface for how taste becomes answers, rather than a drifting
 * copy. Nothing here is brand-specific: the inference only ever emits values it
 * actually observed on real cards, so it can never emit a value the brand's engine
 * would reject (MINI has no saloon/coupe/mpv/diesel — those are brands:['bmw']).
