/*
 * MINI Knockout — the matcher, played as a championship "This or That".
 *
 * One of several interchangeable interface "modes" over the shared engine (see
 * ../modes/index.js and the shell in ../vehicle-matcher.js). Its premise is the
 * same as the swipe game's, in one line: the head-to-head picks silently answer
 * the same questionnaire the `questions` mode asks, and the REAL engine does the
 * matching. See docs/mini-knockout-requirements.md.
 *
 * The flow:
 *   1. A tiny "set your bracket" SEED step (budget + what's it for) — identical to
 *      the swipe game's seed: the two answers a game can't read, and budget is the
 *      engine's one hard filter, so the field is affordable from the first round.
 *   2. A FIELD of the retailer's real stock (POST /api/preview, scoped by the
 *      seed), shuffled and snapped to the largest power of two it can fill (16 → 8
 *      → 4). The field plays a knockout bracket: lean two-card head-to-heads
 *      whittle it to a single champion. Each pick nudges the *taste* answer keys,
 *      weighted by how far a car advances (bracketToAnswers()).
 *   3. A RESULT: the assembled brief goes to the real /api/match (the identical
 *      call the questionnaire mode makes). The player's CHAMPION is the hero of the
 *      reveal — always honoured — and the engine supplies its real "why" and the
 *      honest note when the numbers don't back the crown ("champion, engine
 *      validates"). So the celebration is the player's; the truth is the engine's.
 *
 * This mode owns its own copy, cards and state. It shares only the signal helpers
 * (./match-signal.js) with the swipe game and el/gbp (../ui.js) — the two games
 * read taste and build the engine brief the same way, but look and read
 * differently (a versus, not a swipe stack).
 *
 * The scoring engine and car dataset live behind an API (see server/ and
 * ../engine.js); this mode never sees the dataset — only the public display
 * fields the API returns.

 *
 * Each brand's statRows(a, b) hook returns an ARRAY of row objects, in priority

 * A row is:
 *   { label, aText, bText, winner: 'a' | 'b' | null, tier: 'listing' | 'model' }
 * winner names the side to highlight; null means "no winner / tie" (both plain).
 * A row builder returns null whenever its metric is missing on EITHER car, so a
 * broken or half-empty row never paints.
 *
 * tier records whether the figure describes the individual LISTING (mileage,
 * power, cc, age — the honest default) or the MODEL (0-62, shared by every
 * listing of a line). Model rows are allowed only as SUPPORTING rows: they carry
 * an unambiguous label ("0 to 62") and buildStatPanel drops them if no listing
 * row survives, so a matchup is never described purely by a model figure.
 *
 * These small builders keep each brand's hook terse and guarantee the same
