/*
 * Live retailer-stock client for usedcars.bmw.co.uk.
 *
 * Grassick's BMW (Perth) used stock is served by usedcars.bmw.co.uk — an
 * Auto Trader-powered platform shared by all BMW UK retailers. This module
 * fetches that stock on demand and returns it mapped to the engine's car
 * schema (see mapping.js). The matcher scores against real, buyable cars
 * instead of the static curated dataset.
 *
 * Two wrinkles the implementation has to handle:
 *  1. The list endpoint is CSRF-gated even for GET — a naked request gets
 *     403. We bootstrap a csrftoken cookie from the site root, then send it
 *     back as both a Cookie and an X-CSRFToken header (+ a Referer).
 *  2. Local dev runs on Node 16, which has no global fetch — so this uses
 *     node:https directly (zero-dep, works on every Node version).
 *
 * The token can rotate/expire, so any 403 triggers a single re-bootstrap.
 * Mapped results are cached in-memory for a short TTL so /api/match doesn't
 * refetch the whole retailer on every quiz submission.

/* --------------------------- live Motorrad feed ----------------------- *
 * Motorrad's approved-used stock is served by a session-gated AngularJS app
 * (ng-app="GMBApp") behind POST /api/ResultOverview/ShowResults: it takes a
 * compact filter body and returns a SearchFilter envelope whose `ResTable` is a
 * server-rendered HTML <table> string, one <tr> per bike (see motorrad-listing.js
 * for the parse). The feed authenticates with a `GMB-SID` request header and
 * answers a request without one with a NULL envelope.
 *
 * The breakthrough (confirmed live 2026-08-12): that GMB-SID is NOT minted by JS
 * or a bootstrap endpoint — the server embeds a fresh one in the results landing
 * page as a hidden field <input id="hfSID" value="…"> (base64 of
 * "<caller-ip>;<guid>", UTF-16LE), and the app just reads it with
 * $("#hfSID").val(). So this environment can self-issue a session with no browser:
 * GET the landing page, scrape #hfSID, send it as GMB-SID. Proven cold end to end
 * (scripts/motorrad-live-probe.mjs) and used to build the committed 963-bike
 * snapshot (scripts/fetch-motorrad-all-pages.mjs). See the Motorrad-live section
 * of DECISIONS.md.
 *
 * This adapter walks every page (the feed is 20/page against ~963 bikes),
 * concatenating and de-duping the HTML rows, then maps them through the SAME
 * mapMotorradRaw the committed snapshot was built with. It reuses the same
 * cache/warm/StockUnavailableError contract as the BMW/MINI feed, so a caller
 * can't tell one live brand from another. The live feed is the single source of
 * truth: a fetch failure throws StockUnavailableError (→ 502 at the API), no
 * silent fallback to the snapshot.

 * showing five cars and useless for the Guess Who mode, which offers colour as
 * a HARD FILTER over the whole national pool — a filter that only knows the
 * paint of cars someone happened to look at is a filter that hides stock.
 *
 * So colour gets acquired up front instead, for every car in the pool, by a
 * background pass slow enough to be a good guest. Two properties make that
 * affordable where it would otherwise be absurd:
 *
 *   - Paint is immutable per advert. A car coloured once is coloured forever,
 *     so the expensive pass runs ONCE and every later sweep is a small delta of
 *     adverts that appeared since — minutes, not hours.
 *   - The cost is per advert, not per pool. Keying the store by advert id means
 *     a car that moves between dealers, or drops out of the feed and returns,
 *     is already known.
 *
 * Deliberately slow: COLOUR_WARM_DELAY_MS is one request per second, serial,
 * no concurrency. That is ~4h20m for the first full BMW+MINI pass (12,012 +
 * 3,537 adverts) and roughly 40× under the burst rate that first drew a 429
 * from this platform. The slowness is the feature — the alternative is looking
 * like a scraper to someone else's infrastructure. Do not "optimise" it.
 *
 * Cars whose colour is still unknown are simply excluded from the colour filter
 * while it is in use, and nothing in the UI says "still cataloguing": a caveat
 * would cost more user confidence than the missing cars cost.

 *
 * Idempotent. Call once from server boot — NOT on import, so tests and tooling
 * never fire thousands of requests at someone else's site.
