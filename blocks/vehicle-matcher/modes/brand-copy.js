 * Ferrari copy. Same all-or-nothing build as Honda/Ford/Motorrad: spread the BMW

 * its register. Ferrari's voice is Italian, romantic and heritage-proud, and it
 * speaks to a Ferrarista joining a family, not a shopper making a purchase (per
 * ferrari.com / preowned.ferrari.com: "Join the world of Ferraristi", "La nuova
 * dolce vita", "Configure your dreams", the Prancing Horse, Maranello, Italian
 * excellence since 1947). It leads on emotion and the drive, never on value or
 * spec, and it stays warm and unhurried rather than clipped. Where the honesty
 * frames (unmet / closest / weak) must stay plain and true, they keep their
 * candour but in Ferrari's fuller cadence. No em dashes anywhere.
