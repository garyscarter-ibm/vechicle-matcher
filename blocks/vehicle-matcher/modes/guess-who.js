/*
 * Guess Who — the matcher as an elimination game.
 *
 * The fifth interchangeable interface "mode" (see ../modes/index.js and the
 * shell in ../vehicle-matcher.js), and the only one that is not a recommender.
 * Every other mode ASKS and then RANKS: the engine scores each car against the
 * answers, tolerates a miss, and hands back an ordered shortlist. This one
 * starts with the whole national pool on screen and takes cars AWAY. A filter
 * here is a hard yes/no — no compromise, no score, no "closest we've got".
 *
 * That difference is the whole design, and it drives three unusual choices:
 *
 *   1. IT DOES NOT USE THE ENGINE. Not /api/match, not /api/preview. It fetches
 *      the entire pool once (/api/pool, see apiPool) and filters in the browser.
 *      A soft scorer cannot express "no diesels" — it can only prefer petrol —
 *      so asking the engine for a hard filter would mean asking it to lie.
 *   2. ONE REQUEST, THEN NOTHING. The pool is 377 KB gzip for BMW's 12,084 cars
 *      (columns + dictionaries, see publicPool in server/index.js) and filtering
 *      it is 0.035 ms for eight predicates, so there is no debounce, no
 *      pagination and no loading state after the first paint. Every drag of a
 *      slider re-filters the whole country synchronously.
 *   3. CARD SIZE IS A FUNCTION OF HOW MANY ARE LEFT. Twelve thousand cars only
 *      fit as dots; nine fit as cards you can read. So the board picks the
 *      largest card size whose grid still fits in ~1.9 screens and re-picks it
 *      after every filter — which is what makes the survivors "grow and reflow"
 *      rather than the page just getting shorter. See pickLayout and STAGES.
 *
 * The elimination itself is deliberately cheap: eliminated cards are given a
 * class that transitions ONLY transform and opacity (compositor-safe, so the
 * 12,000-node case never touches the main thread for the fade), and the
 * survivors' reflow is a FLIP — but never at dot stage, because a 12px card's
 * travel is imperceptible, FLIP costs 55 ms at that scale, and there can be
 * thousands of dots each taking a composited layer for it. Measured numbers
 * behind all of this are in docs/spikes/guess-who-render-spike.html.
 *
 * What it shares rather than reinvents: the cards (./result-card.js, with the
 * score badge suppressed because there is no score), the option/slider widgets
 * (./question-ui.js), the brand voice (./brand-copy.js) and the celebration
 * (./match-signal.js). It owns its copy (GUESS_WHO_COPY) and its board, and
 * nothing else.

/*
 * The four densities a card can be drawn at, largest first, each with the range
 * of track widths it owns. The board picks a WIDTH (see pickLayout) and the
 * stage follows from it, rather than the other way round: size is the honest
 * driver, because what a card can usefully say depends on how big it is.
 *
 *   card — the shared .vm-card compact tile: photo, name, specs, paint, seller.
 *          "Similar to Podium but not as tall" — the compact tile, not the big
 *          one, so no blurb, no kit list, no reasons.
 *   tile — photo, model name, price. The smallest size a name is readable at.
 *   chip — photo only. Recognisable as a particular car, says nothing.
 *   dot  — a coloured block. At this size a photo is unreadable AND unaffordable
 *          (12,000 image requests), so the cell carries the one fact that still
 *          survives at 12px: the paint.
 *
 * `body` is the fixed height under the 16:10 photo, used by the fit maths.
