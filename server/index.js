/*
 * BMW Matcher API — zero-dependency Node HTTP server.
 *
 * Runs the matching engine server-side so the scoring weights (engine.js)
 * never reach the browser, and fetches live used-car stock from a real BMW
 * retailer (stock.js) so matches are cars you can actually buy today. The
 * EDS block calls:
 *
 *   GET  /api/questions  → quiz definition (showIf functions stripped)
 *   POST /api/match      → { answers } → { matches } from the configured
 *                          retailer's own stock (fast path). Display-only car
 *                          fields (no tags/specs the engine uses internally,
 *                          so the dataset can't be rebuilt).
 *   POST /api/preview    → { answers } → { matches }: the top few from the
 *                          configured retailer's stock for the quiz's live
 *                          "best guess" drawer. Same scoring + cache as
 *                          /api/match, just a wider slice — served hot from the
 *                          warmed cache so mid-quiz refreshes are cheap.
 *   POST /api/nearby     → { answers } → { nearby }: the best matches at
 *                          *other* retailers close by, each carrying a real
 *                          distance in miles. Split from /api/match so its
 *                          slow national search never blocks the hero matches;
 *                          degrades to [] on any failure (HTTP 200).
 *   GET  /health         → { ok: true }
 *
 * Portable: no framework, no build step. Deploy behind any host; set PORT.

/* ------------------------- the whole-pool wire format ------------------ *

 * sends the ENTIRE national pool, because the Guess Who mode is a hard filter
 * over all of it: the user watches twelve thousand cars become nine, so the
 * client has to hold twelve thousand cars.
 *
 * Sent as columns with dictionaries rather than an array of objects, which is
 * not premature cleverness — it is the difference between viable and not.
 * Measured on the real BMW pool (12,084 cars):
 *
 *   full mapped pool, as-is        865 KB gzip
 *   object per car, filter fields  452 KB gzip
 *   these columns, card-complete   377 KB gzip
 *
 * The saving comes from how little actual variety there is: 553 distinct model
 * names across 12,084 cars, 22 distinct features, one link prefix. Dictionaries
 * turn each of those into an index, and `link` stops being sent at all.
 *
 * Two consequences worth stating, because they are the whole point:
 *  1. ONE request serves the entire mode. There is no hydrate-on-demand tier and
 *     no pagination, so no filter interaction can ever wait on the network.
 *  2. Filtering is then a pass over parallel arrays — measured at 0.035 ms for
 *     eight predicates over 12,012 cars. That is why the mode can re-filter on
 *     every pointer move instead of debouncing.
 *
 * `features` is a BITMASK, not a list: both brands have fewer than 31 distinct
 * feature concepts, so a car's whole equipment set fits in one integer and a
 * must-have test is `(car & wanted) === wanted`.
